Digital signal processeing is the field of engineering that studies the processing of digitilized data. That is data(media or text) that comes in the form of discrete multidimentional arrays of floating point numbers. Usually the data is a mapping between a time stamp and an amplitude unit. Examples are voice signals [time stampe, voltage], gray scale images [pixel intensity]... 
These techniques have gain much importance along side Analog Signal Processing because digital integrated circuits (ICs) have become powerful, easier to use and cost effective. 
The filter applied on digital signals are called digital filters. Many famous digital filters are found in litrature. We are going to use the Butterworth fillters of python's scipy.signal signal processing libraries. This set of basic filters can provide us with building blocks to design more omplexe filters. Mainly low pass, high pass and higher order filters which can be used for integration or derivation of signals.
