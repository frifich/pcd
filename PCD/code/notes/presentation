==> The Pan Tompkins algorithm.
-> The QRS-complex detection process is difficult because of the various types of noise that are present in the signal:
    * Muscle noise, electrodes motion, power-line interference, and the T-wave which have similar high-frequency QRS-complex characteristics.
    * Digital filters reduce the effects of these noise sources, and thereby improve the signal-to-noise ratio
 of the various noise

-> The Pan Tompkins algorithm is a "real time algorithm for QRS complexes detection of ECG signals" [Abstract of original paper by Jiaen PAN and Willis TOMPKINS]

-> The Pan Tompkins algorithm uses a cascading blocks of linear digital filters, nonlinear transformations and a decision rule.

    [raw ecg signal for sick and healthy patient of MIT BIH]
-> Linear process is the bandpass filter, the derivative and the moving window integrator.
    [filtered and differentiated signal of both subjects]
-> Nonlinear transformation is the signal amplitude squaring.
    [squared signal of both subjects]
-> Adaptive threshold for T-wave discrimination is the decision rule.
       ** Every peak is classified either as a QRS peak, or a noise peak (T-wave)

-> QRS complex is a very informative feature of the ECG and hence of the heart activity.
    * An opportunity to automate detection of abnormal heart activity

-> In our case we chose to detect PVC affected beats
    * PVC is //TODO: what is PVC?
    * Detection of PVC can hereby be automated checking variations in R-to-R interval duration.
    * A skipped beat is detected if RRp / RRc is higher or lower than 99% RR_avg
    * PVC is announced if three or more consecutive skipped beats occur in ECG sequence.

-> Test results on patient 106 of MIT BIH.
