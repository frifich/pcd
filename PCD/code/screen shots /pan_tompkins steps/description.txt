In each of the following steps, we will present the input and output of each phase of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm on 5200 samples of ECG records, that is 20 seconds of consecutive recording.

In each phase we have plotted the result of the algorithm on "record 106" of the MIT BIH database, this is the recording of a 64 year old male with first degree Atrioventricular block.
Also we have plotted the result of the algorithm on "record 100" of the MIT BIH database, this is the recording of a healthy 69 year old male.
